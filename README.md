# JS2

This is the code / number for the final version of the hw assignment: cd05de57c055cc8608506e784f638f363bf3478d
Also note, I used <br> or br tags instead of "/n" or new line characters becasue I could not get the new line characters to work. From the research I did, I do not think that work the way I wanted to use them with html. Also note, I spent all my time focusing on the actual data grabbing and passing and less on the website / questions themselves. In fact, I worked out one way to get the radio buttons working.
